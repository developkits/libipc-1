Known bugs
==========

* callgen.b sucks. We should just use Protocol Buffers: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Buffers

Improvements
============
* log.c and log.h are copy-pasta from stated. The same logging mechanism is used in relaunchd.
  It would be good to create a first-class project for logging, or find a better replacement.
