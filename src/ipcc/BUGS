Things that don't work:

* Passing things that sizeof() doesn't return the correct size for.
- Is there any such thing? sizeof() will work on variable-length arrays.

* Passing or returning variable-length strings. 
- Solution: Have a variable-length part of the response. The server replaces pointers
  with offsets into this variable-length area. The offsets will be converted back into
  pointers by the client.

* Passing structures that contain pointers.
- Solution: Use clang to examine the structure to find pointers. Will be very hard.

* A function that returns no values.
- Solution: declare a surrogate for 'void' such as an 'int' that is ignored.
